# How to write a good README File?

As we have understood that a good readme file is necessary, let’s look at writing a good readme file. When writing a readme file, the main focus is it should be brief but also contain all the information needed. In addition, it should have clarity and need to be structured. Some points to help you in writing:

* **Up-to-date**:A readme file should be regularly updated to not conflict with what is uploaded to the repository. If possible, a readme file should contain details about all the version uploads and mention the changes/ updates to the project.

* **Biref and clear**:A readme file should not extend like an essay. It should only have what is necessary and not anything more. It should be written clearly, keeping in mind the reader who is going to read. It should be written in simple language so that everyone can understand. It is better to use bullet points or tables to convey your points better. 

* **Detailed**: The readme file should not miss out on any information. It should contain all the necessary details necessary to understand what the project is about and how to use it. For example, if there exists a need to install software to run the project. Then the version of the software and technical configurations needed to run the project on their computer should be mentioned in full. If you feel the readme file is getting too long, you can break it up and just show what is in the context of the page or folder of the repository. You can also provide links to tutorials or instructions to configure the system or install the necessary software to make it short.
Self Explanatory:  The user shouldn’t need to refer to some other article to understand your readme file. It should be self-contained, as the user should be able to understand everything by reading it. So it’s best to write everything in layman’s terms for the common reader to understand because you never know who is going to read it. As developers, we do try to avoid writing the basics because it’s quite normal. But it’s best to write it as the reader might be a beginner in the field.

# What is a good template to write a README File?

There are multiple layouts or formats on the web which will help you in writing a readme file. No matter which template you follow, make sure that it follows all the points listed above. So let’s just look at one of them:

**Project Title**

A little brief about what the project is about. It should be like a small summary format informing about the main purpose of the project.

**Motivation**

This section is for letting the reader know why you created this project, the reason behind pursuing such a project, and why you have decided to do it.

**Build Status**

This basically explains the current build status of the project. If there is a bug /error which needs addressing. This is done so for two different reasons The user understands that this is an issue and does not spend more time figuring if it was a mistake on their part.A developer who is familiar with the issue can suggest some solutions directly without going through the whole code.

**Code Style**

This lets the users know that you have used a particular code style and helps them when contributing to your project so that the whole project code style stays the same. Some common code styles: standard, xo, etc.

**Screenshots**

As the saying goes, a picture is equal to a thousand words. Most people will be interested if there is a visual representation of what the project is about. It helps them understand better. A visual representation can be snapshots of the project or a video of the functioning of the project.

**Tech/Framework used**

This is used to help the reader understand which tech or frameworks have been used to do the project. It helps the reader understand which all tech stack he has to be familiar with to understand the whole project.

**Features**

This is where you write what all extra features have been done in your project. Basically, this is where you try to make your project stand out from the rest.

**Code Examples**

This is where you try to compress your project and make the reader understand what it does as simple as possible. This should help the reader understand if your code solves their issue.

**Installation**

If your project needs the installation of certain software or configurations to the system. Do mention it in this section as it helps a lot for the reader to use your project. The steps mentioned should be precise and explanatory.  If possible, you can add links that can help them better understand how to configure/install the necessary files or software.

**API reference**

If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented.

**Tests**

This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples

**How to Use?**

As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain the steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.

**Contribute**

This is where you let them know that they can contribute and help you out. A guideline on how to contribute is also helpful

**Credits**

Giving proper credit is most important. Mention any links/repos which helped you or inspired you to build this project. It can be a blog, another open source project, or just people who have contributed to building this project.

**Lisence**

A short description of the license. (MIT, Apache, etc.)

# How to make your README file more interesting?

Now that you have understood what to write in a readme. Let’s look at how to make it interesting to read. The main issue with readme files is they can look like a terms and conditions page of a product. It is a long page filled with information. This is not at all interesting to the user. So some method to improve your readme file is by adding images and visual representations. Having images helps it become more colourful and more attractive. It also helps in better understanding for some people. Everyone might not be familiar with all the technical jargon which we use. So showing visual representation helps more in that case. Adding funny-related memes or videos also helps in some ways.

## How the README file is intended for different users

***

1. **For end-users:** A readme file answers questions about installing the versions of software needed for the project to run. The configuration steps are to be done so that everything runs smoothly. The readme file also answers questions basically based on which framework and coding language was used. It also helps the user understand why a certain framework was used instead of another. How the owner of the project got inspired, the method by which he solved the issue, and much more.

2. **For our own development work:** A readme file provides two good use cases. First, if it is written prior to starting the development, it helps the developer by acting as a roadmap or tracker so that he is aware of what is left to do in the project life cycle. Second, it helps the developer understand the code that he might have written a few years back better when there is a need for it to be revisited and de-bugged. This helps a lot since it takes a lot of time to understand the code when you have to scrape through millions of lines of code that you might have written a few years back. The readme file helps you locate where each section of the code is and helps you find the piece of code you were looking for. It is a great time saver when the issue is critical and time-bound.

3. **For other developers:** The readme file serves a similar purpose to other developers going through the code and helps them understand where each section of code is located and which page contains the logic. This helps when there is an issue in the code, and another developer is trying to solve the issue. He can go through the code easily and find where the issue is. Likewise, if another developer is trying to enhance the code, then a good readme file goes a long way in helping that person.

So to wrap it all up. First, we have gone through the definition of the readme. The format in which it is written. Common syntax to be used, which will help you in writing one. Things to keep in mind while writing a readme file. A common template to follow and understand what to write and what not to write in a readme file. And last, we saw how the readme file is useful for different types of readers/users.
